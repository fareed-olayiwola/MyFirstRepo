Learning Reflections

So far in this course, I have learned the fundamentals of version control using Git and GitHub. I now understand how to create repositories, work with branches, and collaborate with others through pull requests. These skills are essential for modern software development and teamwork.

One of the most valuable lessons has been understanding how branching allows developers to work on features independently without affecting the main codebase. I've also learned how forking enables open-source collaboration, allowing anyone to contribute to projects while maintaining control over the original repository.
